# <H1> How Do Adjectives Work? <H1>

An adjective is a word that describes a noun. Hebrew adjectives match the gender and number of the noun they describe. If a noun is feminine, the adjective describing it will also be feminine.  If a noun is plural, the adjective describing it will also be plural. The Nonbinary Hebrew Project proposes that adjectives describing third-gender nouns should also be in third-gender form. This applies to both the singular and plural forms of adjectives.

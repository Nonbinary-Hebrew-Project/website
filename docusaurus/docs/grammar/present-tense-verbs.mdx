## Present Tense

A verb is a word that conveys an action. Present tense means that the action is happening right now. A Hebrew verb in the present tense matches the gender and number of the noun that comes before it, just like an adjective. If a noun is masculine, the verb that follows it will also be masculine. If a noun is plural, the verb that follows it will also be plural. Some Hebrew sentences will not have a verb at all. The placement of letters and vowel markers in a verb determines how that verb will be conjugated. 
 The Nonbinary Hebrew project proposes that verbs which follow third-gender nouns should also be in third-gender form. This guide uses the third person singular English neopronoun Xe, pronounced “zee,” to illustrate this grammatical function.

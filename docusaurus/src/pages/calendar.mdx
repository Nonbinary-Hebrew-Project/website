We will be hosting an open house workshop on Sunday, May 18th at 2:30 pm on Zoom.

We will tell the story of the project, break out into groups to deep dive into Nonbinary Hebrew grammar, or learn more about the project's philosophy. If you're interested in the grammar breakout room, some Hebrew experience is recommended.

This workshop is free and open to the public! Real-time captioning will be provided.

# Mission Statement

The Nonbinary Hebrew Project is a free, community-based language initiative. Its third-gender Hebrew grammatical system provides a growing, global network of Hebrew speakers and learners with the tools to forge meaningful liturgy and conversations in Jewish community. The Nonbinary Hebrew Project hosts language workshops and works with Hebrew users to develop affirming applications of third-gender Hebrew for personal and ritual use.

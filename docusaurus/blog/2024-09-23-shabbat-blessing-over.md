As a Rabbi, I can find baby naming ceremony applied uses, so that I can officiate a baby naming ceremony.

As a hebrew learner, I can find grammar charts, so that I can supplement my learning materials.

As a Jewish person that doesn't know hebrew and is building a personal practice, I want to find transliterated+translated prayers that fit my personal spiritual preferences, so that I can reconnect to Jewish practice in an incremental, accessible way.

As a journalist, I can find previously written articles or an About page, so that I can understand the story of the nonbinary hebrew project.

As a queer jewish person, I can find links to queer jewish resources, so that I can connect to queer jewish community in abundance.
